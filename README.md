Robotics and Automation – 2-DOF Robot Motion Control (MATLAB)
Developed a complete kinematic and dynamic model of a planar 2-DOF robotic manipulator with two rotary joints. Implemented forward and inverse kinematics, Jacobian matrix, and full dynamic model (inertia, Coriolis, and gravity terms). Planned robot motion between three points using cubic polynomial trajectory interpolation and point-to-point control. Designed a decentralized PD controller and analyzed system behavior under external disturbances applied at the end-effector. Numerical integration and simulation were performed in MATLAB, with detailed analysis of joint trajectories, Cartesian motion, and joint torques.
